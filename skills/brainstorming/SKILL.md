# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context. Ask only the questions that genuinely matter — and ask them batched into one or two messages, not dripped out one at a time. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design (or a Fast Path proposal — see below) and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Fast Path: Skip the Spec

The full Q&A → spec doc → review loop is appropriate when requirements are ambiguous or design decisions remain. When they don't, the spec phase is overhead, not safety. Choose the lightest path that still gives the work the discipline it needs.

**Skip the spec** when ALL of these hold:
- The user's request specifies what to build clearly enough that no design decisions remain
- Scope is bounded — one component, no architectural choices, no fan-out to sub-projects
- A reasonable engineer could pick a single sensible approach without further consultation

Procedure:
1. State your understanding in one paragraph: "I'll [description]. Skipping spec, going straight to plan. Confirm?"
2. Wait for user confirmation. If they push back or surface a design question, fall back to the full checklist.
3. Invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` directly.

**Skip the plan too** for changes so small a plan doc is overhead — single-file edit, mechanical rename, dependency bump, typo, fully-specified one-shot fix:
1. State the exact change: "I'll [exact action] in [file(s)]. Confirm?"
2. Wait for confirmation.
3. Implement. Verify.

**The HARD-GATE still applies on every path.** The Fast Path replaces the design *document* with a shorter proposal — it does NOT skip the approval gate. You always present the proposal and get explicit user approval before touching code.

**Anti-rationalization check.** "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. If you're stretching the criteria — "well, it's only two components" or "the user probably means…" — take the heavier path. A 30-second clarifying question is cheaper than building the wrong thing. When in doubt, brainstorm.

## Full Checklist

If the Fast Path doesn't apply, follow the full flow. Create a task for each item and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Offer visual companion** (if topic will involve visual questions) — this is its own message, not combined with a clarifying question. See the Visual Companion section below.
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — batched into one message when possible; focus on purpose/constraints/success criteria
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
5. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
6. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit. As you write, watch for placeholders/TBDs, internal contradictions, and ambiguous requirements; fix them inline. No separate self-review pass.
7. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
8. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** Do NOT invoke frontend-design, mcp-builder, or any other implementation skill. The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, batch your clarifying questions into a single message — don't drip them out one at a time
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Ask only the questions you genuinely need answered to design well; do not pad with nice-to-have questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design - the way a good developer improves code they're working in.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design (spec) to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
  - (User preferences for spec location override this default)
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Spec Quality (inline while writing):**
As you write the spec, watch for and fix in-place:
- Placeholders ("TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, vague requirements)
- Internal contradictions or architecture that doesn't match the feature description
- Scope creep — if it sprawls into multiple subsystems, decompose
- Ambiguous requirements — pick one interpretation and make it explicit

This is something you do *while writing*, not a separate pass after.

**User Review Gate:**
Once the spec is written, ask the user to review it before proceeding:

> "Spec written and committed to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we start writing out the implementation plan."

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and ask again. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **Batch clarifying questions** - Ask all your real unknowns in one message. Don't drip them out one at a time.
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Visual Companion

A browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Available as a tool — not a mode. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through the browser.

**Offering the companion:** When you anticipate that upcoming questions will involve visual content (mockups, layouts, diagrams), offer it once for consent:
> "Some of what we're working on might be easier to explain if I can show it to you in a web browser. I can put together mockups, diagrams, comparisons, and other visuals as we go. This feature is still new and can be token-intensive. Want to try it? (Requires opening a local URL)"

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Do not combine it with clarifying questions, context summaries, or any other content. The message should contain ONLY the offer above and nothing else. Wait for the user's response before continuing. If they decline, proceed with text-only brainstorming.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use the browser or the terminal. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

A question about a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What does personality mean in this context?" is a conceptual question — use the terminal. "Which wizard layout works better?" is a visual question — use the browser.

If they agree to the companion, read the detailed guide before proceeding:
